# data-hooking-class
If you want to include this "class" into your kernel project then include DataHook.h from INCLUDES into your project.
If you want to see an example of how to use this library to make hooks/call then open the:
- "ExampleUM.cpp" to see examples of how to call the hook from the usermode.
- "ExampleKM.cpp" to see examples of how to use the DataHook.h library to set hooks.
This project *WILL* get you banned on most games with popular anticheats (BE, EAC, etc) but it may work for more simple games that have semi-advanced anticheats.
